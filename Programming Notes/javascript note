difference between findindex indexof include 
the sort() only compares the first element wether it is number or the alphabet then if the first character is same then it compare the second element. 

Sort(sort function)  we can put the function inside it to compare the two numbers and the right function is array.sort( (a,b )=> a-b)

every thing in the javascript is an object and to form the we can form object by making var obj = {} and we can set the key and value pair for the object using obj.ram = 0 and we can make the object counter as obj.ram += 1 

=====================           Array in the javascript         =================================
